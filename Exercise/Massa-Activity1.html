		<h3>About Me</h3>
			<h4>Personal Background</h4>
				<p>
					My name is <b><i>Andrea Massa</i></b> I have lived in Charlotte for the past 5
					years; however, I am originally from Napoli, Italy, I was born and raised there. My first language is
					Italian but I also speak fluent English and Spanish.<br>
				</p>
			<h4>Professional Background</h4>
				<p>
					I am a full time Computer Science student with 0 work experience in the field. I do work
					part-time in an Italian restaurant in Charlotte.
				</p>
			<h4>Academic Background</h4>
				<p>I graduated high-school in 2017 in order to start community college and graduate with an associate in arts
				in 2019. I then started my studies at UNCC with a major in psychology to then realize after my first semester that
				I loved coding. So I have decided to switch my major to Computer Science and keep Psychology as a minor. I am now
				planning to graduate May 2022 or December 2022.</p>
			<h4>Background in the Course</h4>
				<p>
					I have limited experience in HTML and CSS and no experience in JavaScript. I also have no knowledge on how the
					Internet actually works and about computer networks. Most of the material in this course is new to me.
				</p>
			<h4>Primary Computer Platform</h4>
				ASUS Desktop
				<ul>
					<li><b>Processor: </b>Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9700F CPU @ 3.00GH 3.00 GHz </li>
					<li><b>RAM: </b>16.0 GB </li>
				</ul>
			<h4>Courses Taking</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>ITIS 3135 - Web Design & Development</li>
					<li>ITSC 3146 - Intro Operating Systems & Networking</li>
					<li>ITCS 4230 - Intro to Game Design and Development</li>
					<li>ITCS 3160 - Database Design & Implementation</li>
				</ul>
			<h4>Interesting Story</h4>
			<p>I have tried to learn web development before but once CSS was brought to the table
			I got so frustrated with the alignments of divs that I gave up.</p>

		<h3>Why Did I Choose This Course</h3>
		<p>
			<em>I have taken this course as a requirement for my major</em>. I do classify this as a really useful course.
			The fundamentals of Web Design are particularly useful and I am excited to learn about them.<br>
			This is what I expect to learn from this course:
			<ul>
				<li>How do computer's requests to files and data on the internet work</li>
				<li>HTML, CSS and how do they work together</li>
				<li>JavaScript and what does it exactly do</li>
				<li>Other web development frameworks</li>
				<li>Working on a project that can be useful for a post-graduation portfolio</li>
			</ul>
